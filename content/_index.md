Hi! I'm a computer programmer from San Jose, CA. I currently study computer
science and mathematics at the University of California, Berkeley.

I'm interested in systems and computer infrastructure â€” in particular,
distributed systems and cloud computing. I work heavily with tools like
[Kubernetes] and am a big fan of [Elixir], [Rust], and [Nix/NixOS].

At UC Berkeley, I'm involved in the [Open Computing Facility], the [Berkeley
Math Tournament], [AutoLAB], and [CS 162]. In my free time, I also participate
in events such as [Advent of Code], where I placed 17th last year.
